# Website Changes - Feb 18, 2026

## Summary
Removed the large "See It In Action" demo video section. Individual task demo videos will be added directly to the 6 feature cards in the Features section instead.

---

## What Changed

### ❌ Removed
**"See It In Action" demo video section** (was at line ~440 in index.html)
- Large standalone video placeholder
- "Watch the AI in 60 seconds" messaging
- Separate CTA button below video

### ✅ Kept
**6 individual video placeholders** in Features section (starting line ~230)
- Each feature card already has a video embed ready
- Just need to add actual video IDs once recorded
- More engaging format - demos right next to feature descriptions

2. **📅 Interview Coordination** (Save 5-8 hrs/week)

## Next Steps to Add Videos

1. **Record demos** - Use Chuck as demo bot, roleplay as Sarah
2. **Upload to YouTube/Loom** - Get embed codes
3. **Edit index.html** - Replace `VIDEO_ID_HERE` with actual IDs
4. **Test locally** - Open index.html in browser, verify videos load
5. **Push to GitHub** - Netlify auto-deploys

**Full guide:** See `VIDEO-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` in this folder
